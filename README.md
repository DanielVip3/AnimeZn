# AnimeZn
<br />I don't even know how to describe this project, but I think "useless" is the correct word.
<br />
This project had two main uses before: learn Vue and create a working AnimeList for myself(because my MyAnimeList theme is bugged, and anime covers do not show up anymore).

<br />So, I initially started this project using MAL API.
<br />Then I found about AniList: it was a lot more convenient.
<br />
But I learned a lot about Vue, and I thought it was the case to stop with this project, so I just end it incomplete because I don't need it anymore.
<br />
This now only works as a proof that I used and learned Vue in the past, and doesn't have any other functionality anymore.
<br />
Also, you can find, sometimes, shitty code, because I was lazy.
